# GRAD Caucus Launch Event

The launch reception will be on July 13th, 2022 from 3pm to 5pm at Banquet Room 2060 in the [Rayburn House Office Building](https://goo.gl/maps/aM972iwiLaS4fxi56). Food and drinks will be provided. Check back for more details on location, agenda, and more.

## Attire

For those who are unfamiliar with norms of attire on the Hill, business professional attire is encouraged. Jackets, ties, and solid color dresses will be common, though we recognize there isn't any single definition of business professional and won't be actively enforcing a dress code.

## Location and Access

The Rayburn House Office Building is just south of the US Capitol. It is the largest and most western of the House office buildings. Entrances can be found on the northern and eastern sides of the building. The reception is being held in Banquet Room 2060 which is on the ground (zeroth) floor in the southwestern corridor of the building, as indicated on the maps below.

Access rules to the building are actively changing due to the coronavirus pandemic and security concerns. As a result, attendees who are not Congressional staff may require escorts to enter. We will update this page with more details and instructions as we get closer to the event.

The two closest metro stops are Capitol South Station (~7 min walk) and Federal Center SW (~9 min walk).
