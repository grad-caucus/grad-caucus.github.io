## 2022-07-13: The GRAD Caucus has launched!

The GRAD Caucus has launched. We repeat: the GRAD Caucus has launched. The launch was celebrated with a reception in the Rayburn House Office building and was packed with graduate students, congressional staffers, representatives of a variety of professional and advocacy organizations, and, of course, the lovely co-chairs of the caucus themselves. A hearty thanks to the congressional offices and graduate students who worked together to make this event and the caucus a reality!
