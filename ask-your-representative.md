# How to Get Involved

## Members of Congress
We are actively recruiting new members to the caucus. There is no membership fee or eligibility requirements, just an interest in supporting graduate student researchers! If that includes you, just contact one of the caucus co-chairs about joining:

- Zoe Lofgren (D-CA)
- Stephanie Bice (R-FL)
- Gus Bilirakis (R-FL)
- Mike Doyle (D-PA)

## Graduate Students and Other Members of the Public
In order to support graduate student researchers, we need involvement from graduate students from across the country. We also welcome support from other members of the public, because the work the graduate students do impacts everyone. At this time there are a few ways to get involved.

### Ask your Representative to Join the Caucus
The most compelling reason for a member of Congress to join the GRAD Caucus is if they know that it matters to their constituents, so we would love it if you are willing to reach out to your Representative and ask for their support. We provide resources on [how to go about doing that here].
