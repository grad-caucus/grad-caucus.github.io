# Template for Emailing Your Representative


Dear Representative ____________,

As a constituent and a graduate student at _________, I strongly encourage you to join the new Graduate Research and Development (GRAD) Caucus. Across the nation, there are millions of graduate researchers at universities conducting groundbreaking work in coordination with federal research agencies and the private sector. They mentor undergraduate students, enrich society through the arts and humanities, and are future leaders in nearly every sector through starting companies and forming a globally competitive workforce. Graduate researchers’ impact on our collective understanding of the world and contribution to strengthening our nation’s economy is often overlooked and understated despite the fact that behind every major breakthrough is a current or former graduate researcher.

[Provide a *short* description of your research and, if possible, its potential benefits to the country or world. Then briefly discuss your career plans and how graduate school is preparing you for that career.] While these details are unique to me, my general situation is not. Please show your support for graduate researchers across the country by joining the GRAD Caucus.

Sincerely,

[Your Name] <br>
[Your Title (e.g. Masters Student, PhD Student, Doctoral Candidate, etc.)] <br>
[Your Department/Field] <br>
[Your Institution/University] <br>
[Your Address] <br>
