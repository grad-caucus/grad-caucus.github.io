## Background

Across the nation, there are millions of graduate researchers at universities conducting groundbreaking work in coordination with federal research agencies and the private sector. They mentor undergraduate students, enrich society through the arts and humanities, and are future leaders in nearly every sector through starting companies and forming a globally competitive workforce. Graduate researchers’ impact on our collective understanding of the world and contribution to strengthening our nation’s economy is often overlooked and understated despite the fact that behind every major breakthrough is a current or former graduate researcher. For this reason, it is imperative that graduate student researchers have a congressional caucus that represents their interests.

## What is a caucus?

A congressional caucus is a group of members of the United States Congress that join together around a common topic or legislative agenda. On the House side, they are formally registered with the House Committee on Administration and consist of usually 2-4 co-chairs and some number of other members.

## What is the GRAD Caucus?

The Graduate Research and Development (GRAD) Caucus is a newly formed bipartisan caucus in the House of Representatives centered on the current backbone and future leaders of United States science, graduate researchers. The caucus will provide briefings on programs and policies important to graduate researchers, educate members of Congress on the work and impact of graduate researchers, and provide a forum for members to advance policy solutions needed to support these researchers.

## Who is leading the GRAD Caucus?

The caucus is led by four co-chairs, Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA-18), Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-FL-12), Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA-19), and Rep. Stephanie Bice (R-OK-5).

## What topics will the GRAD Caucus focus on?
As the policies that impact graduate researchers are vast, there are many topics that the GRAD Caucus will focus on. Some of our top priorities include:
