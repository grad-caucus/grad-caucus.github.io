## About the Caucus

Across the nation, there are millions of graduate researchers at universities conducting groundbreaking work in coordination with federal research agencies and the private sector. They mentor undergraduate students, enrich society through the arts and humanities, and are future leaders in nearly every sector through starting companies and forming a globally competitive workforce. Graduate researchers’ impact on our collective understanding of the world and contribution to strengthening our nation’s economy is often overlooked and understated despite the fact that behind every major breakthrough is a current or former graduate researcher. For this reason, it is imperative that graduate student researchers have a congressional caucus that represents their interests.

The GRAD Caucus is co-chaired by Rep. Mike Doyle (PA-18), Rep. Gus Bilirakis (FL-12), Rep. Zoe Lofgren (CA-19), and Rep. Stephanie Bice (OK-5).
