## Background

Across the nation, there are millions of graduate researchers at universities conducting groundbreaking work in coordination with federal research agencies and the private sector. They mentor undergraduate students, enrich society through the arts and humanities, and are future leaders in nearly every sector through starting companies and forming a globally competitive workforce. Graduate researchers’ impact on our collective understanding of the world and contribution to strengthening our nation’s economy is often overlooked and understated despite the fact that behind every major breakthrough is a current or former graduate researcher.

## Mission

The bipartisan GRAD Caucus is led by Representatives Mike Doyle (D-PA-18), Gus Bilirakis (R-FL-12), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA-19), and Stephanie Bice (R-OK-5) to highlight the unique and critical role that graduate researchers play in innovation, education, and bolstering our economy. The GRAD Caucus provides briefings on policies and programs important to graduate researchers, connections to graduate researchers performing groundbreaking research across the nation, and a forum for members to advance policy solutions needed to support these researchers as they support society.
